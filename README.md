# SmartRestaurant
Project for the SIRS course 2016 @ IST.
# Setup
## Support Software
Apart from Java and Maven, you will require mysql server installed and running.</br>
Go to the extras/mysql directory and run both scripts, one will create an user and other will create a database. The tables will be automatically created by FÃ©nix Framework.

## Get a client to work
For the client to recognize the methods from the server, you will need to get the server running and then get the wsdl from it, since this project is done in a implementation-first way. Check the client example for concrete code.
